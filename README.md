## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### üéØ Changing the Countdown Target

Open `script.js` and update the target date:

```js
const targetDate = new Date("2028-09-29T00:00:00+05:30");
```

---

## üí¨ Managing Quotes

Inspirational quotes are stored in `quotes.json`. You can add, clean, and organize them using the built-in Python script.

### ‚ûï Adding New Quotes

Edit `quotes.json` manually using this format:

```json
{
  "q": "Your inspiring quote goes here.",
  "a": "Author's Name"
}
```

> If the author is unknown, use `"a": "Unknown"` ‚Äî the script will normalize it to `"Anonymous"`.

---

### üßπ Cleaning and Fixing Quotes

The included `quote.py` script performs the following:

- ‚úÖ **Deduplication by Similarity:** Removes quotes that are _almost identical_ (90% similarity threshold).
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Author Correction:** Replaces `"Anonymous"` with a specific author if found in a duplicate.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **"Unknown" Normalization:** Converts `"Unknown"` to `"Anonymous"`.
- üìÅ **Archiving Removed Quotes:** Stores removed quotes in `removed_quotes.json` along with their matched counterparts.
- üîÄ **Optional Shuffling:** Enable shuffling by setting `flag=True` in the script.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Script

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Place `quote.py` in the same directory as `quotes.json`.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python quote.py
   ```

The script will output:

- Original quote count
- Cleaned quote count
- Removed quote count

### ü§ñ Error Handling Fallback

If quotes cannot be loaded, a fallback quote is shown:

```js
  {
    "q": "Oops! The quotes went on vacation without telling us.",
    "a": "The Missing Quote Squad"
  }
```
